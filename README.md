#Wraith

Wraith is a programmatic WhatsApp personality emulator
Think of it as a ghost version of you who replies instantly
Or when you get tired of typing to people you don‚Äôt care about anymore

Supports contextual conversation using in-memory message history

Swappable LLM backend (default is Gemini but you should use something free)

QR-based auth

Persistent session via multi-file auth state

Why Wraith?

Girlfriend set kro
Baad mein agar 2 din tak reply na do
Wraith reply kar dega
‚Äúoye sorry busy tha project mein üòî‚Äù
No more left on seen
It‚Äôs automation with just enough emotion to keep things alive

Request Limits & Delay Handling

‚ö†Ô∏è LLMs aren‚Äôt infinite

If you spam 20+ messages per minute
Free APIs will throttle you
Response time will spike
Or worse you'll hit a 429 Too Many Requests and get soft-banned

Mitigation:

Add rate limiting logic

Queue requests

Delay processing with setTimeout

Or use multiple API keys (rotate them)

Free API Replacements (Because Gemini cries too soon)

Ollama	local LLMs like LLaMA 3 no internet
HuggingFace	inference endpoint with token limits
